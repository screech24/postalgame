## Technical Considerations

### Asset Creation Strategy
- **Building Creation**: 
  - Use Three.js BoxGeometry, CylinderGeometry for basic structures
  - Combine primitives to create complex buildings
  - Apply custom materials and shaders for Ghibli-style appearance
  
- **Character Creation**:
  - Use simplified geometries for character models
  - Focus on distinctive silhouettes rather than details
  - Apply toon shaders for Ghibli-like appearance
  
- **Environment Elements**:
  - Create trees using cylinder and sphere combinations
  - Generate terrain using mathematical functions and displacement
  - Design water effects with custom shaders

### Performance Optimization
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Simplify geometry for distant objects
- **Frustum Culling**: Only render what's in the camera view
- **Shader Optimization**: Efficient GLSL code
- **Geometry Instancing**: Reuse geometry for similar objects

### Browser Compatibility
- Target modern browsers with WebGL support
- Implement fallbacks where possible
- Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Offline Functionality
- Cache core game assets in service worker
- Allow limited gameplay without internet connection
- Save progress locally

## Code-based Asset Creation

### Building Creation Example
```javascript
function createGhibliBuilding(width, height, depth, colorPalette) {
  // Create main structure
  const buildingGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(width, height, depth);
  const buildingMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    uniforms: {
      baseColor: { value: new THREE.Color(colorPalette.base) },
      lightDirection: { value: new THREE.Vector3(0.5, 1, 0.8) }
    },
    vertexShader: toonVertexShader,
    fragmentShader: toonFragmentShader
  });
  
  const building = new THREE.Mesh(buildingGeometry, buildingMaterial);
  
  // Add roof
  const roofGeometry = new THREE.ConeGeometry(width * 0.7, height * 0.3, 4);
  const roofMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
    uniforms: {
      baseColor: { value: new THREE.Color(colorPalette.roof) },
      lightDirection: { value: new THREE.Vector3(0.5, 1, 0.8) }
    },
    vertexShader: toonVertexShader,
    fragmentShader: toonFragmentShader
  });
  
  const roof = new THREE.Mesh(roofGeometry, roofMaterial);
  roof.position.y = height / 2 + height * 0.15;
  roof.rotation.y = Math.PI / 4;
  
  // Create windows
  const windows = createWindows(width, height, depth, colorPalette.window);
  
  // Group all elements
  const buildingGroup = new THREE.Group();
  buildingGroup.add(building);
  buildingGroup.add(roof);
  buildingGroup.add(windows);
  
  return buildingGroup;
}
```

### Toon Shader Example
```glsl
// Vertex shader
const toonVertexShader = `
  varying vec3 vNormal;
  varying vec3 vPosition;
  
  void main() {
    vNormal = normalize(normalMatrix * normal);
    vPosition = (modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0)).xyz;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
  }
`;

// Fragment shader
const toonFragmentShader = `
  uniform vec3 baseColor;
  uniform vec3 lightDirection;
  
  varying vec3 vNormal;
  varying vec3 vPosition;
  
  void main() {
    vec3 normal = normalize(vNormal);
    vec3 light = normalize(lightDirection);
    
    float intensity = dot(normal, light);
    
    // Toon shading steps
    if (intensity > 0.95) intensity = 1.0;
    else if (intensity > 0.5) intensity = 0.7;
    else if (intensity > 0.25) intensity = 0.5;
    else intensity = 0.3;
    
    gl_FragColor = vec4(baseColor * intensity, 1.0);
  }
`;
```
